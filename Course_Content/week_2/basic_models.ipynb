    "Many physics lecture demonstrations illustrate that motion in the x-direction and motion in the y-direction are indeed independent of each other, as assumed in the derivation of the equations for projectile motion. One popular demonstration is called  “shoot the monkey,” motivated by the following story. A monkey has escaped from the zoo and has climbed a tree. The zookeeper wants to shoot the monkey with a tranquilizer dart in order to recapture it, but she knows that the monkey will let go of the branch it is holding onto at the sound of the gun firing. Her challenge is therefore to hit the monkey in the air as it is falling.\n",

    "Where does the zookeeper need to aim to hit the falling monkey?\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "The zookeeper must aim directly at the monkey assuming that the time for the sound of the gun firing to reach the monkey is negligible and the speed of the dart is fast enough to cover the horizontal distance to the tree. As soon as the dart leaves the gun, it is in free fall, just like the monkey. Because both the monkey and the dart are in free fall, they fall with the same acceleration, independent of the dart’s motion in the x-direction and of the dart’s initial velocity. The dart and the monkey will meet at a point directly below the point from which the monkey dropped.\n",
